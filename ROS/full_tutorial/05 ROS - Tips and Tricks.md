Ever wish you could just swap your stated ROS_MASTER_URIs and ROS_HOSTNAMEs **without** having to go `$ sudo nano ~/.bashrc` or typing out the entire line?

**Aliases** have you covered! (For more than just those purposes!)

Inside ~/.bashrc:

```bash
alias command_name="<run this as if you ran it in terminal>" 
# Don't add spaces between the = sign and the words, it'll break it

# So for the IP change example:
alias rosinit_local="export ROS_HOSTNAME = localhost && export ROS_MASTER_URI = http://localhost:11311"
```

Now, you can do this!

```shell
$ rosinit_local

# Is equivalent to running
$ export ROS_HOSTNAME = localhost && export ROS_MASTER_URI = http://localhost:11311
```

And your IPs will be set accordingly! Easy!




```
                            .     .
                         .  |\-^-/|  .    
                        /| } O.=.O { |\
```
